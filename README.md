##Projects

Kepler's problem orbital propogation MATLAB project
  MATLAB function inputting topocentric horizon coordinates and outputting propogated orbit in 48 hours
  Performs coordinate transformation and solves Kepler's problem without using MATLAB built-in aerospace tools
  
Level 3 High Power Rocket (In Progress)
  Successfully launched and recovered 4 different high power rockets at speeds of up to Mach 1.3 and altitudes up to 9,593 feet using composite materials, 3D printed avionics housings, and tested electronics-based parachute recovery, sufficient experience for approval to attempt the Tripoli Rocketry Association Level 3 process: https://www.tripoli.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=795696&module_id=479470 
  Submitted email proposal with high level design to advisory panel
  Designed 13 foot tall, 6 inch diameter fiberglass rocket in SolidWorks
  Analyzed and optimized second order dynamical stability using MATLAB scripts to achieve adequate corrective moment coefficient and damping ratio for safe flight
  Designed and 3D printed fin alignment jigs, radial hole drilling jigs, and avionics mounting components
  Designed improved wire harnessing scheme compared to previous rockets, potentially saving about half an hour in integration time at the launch field
  Calculated recovery system harnessing hardware safety factors and shear pin shear strength to determine adequate pressurization for parachute deployment
